wakeup-light-boosterpack
========================

A boosterpack for Texas Instruments' MSP430 Launchpad platform.

My body doesn't seem to be designed to get out of bed without loud
complaints.  This is especially true in the winter months, when I have
to be out of bed before the sun comes up.  This boosterpack is
designed to help, by tickling those blue light-sensitive cones in the
eye that tell the body to wake up.

Blue light wakes you up?

It seems so.

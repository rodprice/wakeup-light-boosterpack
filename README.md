wakeup-light-boosterpack
========================

A boosterpack for Texas Instruments' MSP430 Launchpad platform.

My body doesn't seem to be designed to get out of bed without loud
complaints.  This is especially true in the winter months, when I have
to be out of bed before the sun comes up.  This boosterpack is
designed to help, by tickling blue light sensitive cells in the
eye that tell the body to wake up.

Blue light wakes you up?
------------------------

It
[seems](http://gizmodo.com/5701003/blue-lighting-wakes-schoolkids-up)
[so](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1333029/Blue-lighting-trialled-British-school-wake-drowsy-pupils-thing-morning.html)
[1].  In the past two or three years, scientists have found that, in
addition to the rods and cones, the eye has a
[third type of photoreceptor](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110119/full/469284a.html
"Vision sciene: Seeing without seeing") [2].  Among other things,
these cells send the brain signals about when to sleep and when to
wake up.  They respond to blue light; the bright blue from the sky
that surrounds us outdoors on a sunny day.  They take "rise and shine"
literally: the sun is up, the sky is blue, so wake up!

A word of caution: blue light isn't always good for you.  Too much,
especially in the absence of other light, can
[damage your eyes](http://www.mdsupport.org/library/hazard.html) [3].
(Be especially careful if you have had cataract surgery.)  At the
wrong time of day, it will mess up your
[circadian rhythm](http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/health&id=8779461)
[4] (body clock).  And if you have a tendency to migraine headaches,
you
[might not want to use this light](http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/01/11-01.html?etoc
"Why light makes migraines worse") [5] at all.  If in doubt, consult
your doctor.
